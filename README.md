# Google Scholar alert digest
> aggregate google scholar email alerts by paper

Simplifies scientific paper discovery by aggregating all unread emails under
a Gmail label from the Google Scholar alerts, grouping papers by title and producing a report ([Markdown](https://gist.github.com/bzz/1e8445f71db03a7d57d94147279ee09f)/[HTML](https://gist.github.com/bzz/e1e3ef3e0cdabc254f4e75bfa5511bcb)/[JSON](https://gist.github.com/bzz/4feeec459bcd1ec21f919eaeb163ac7a)).

# How to use

To use this tool for generating a report on new papers from Google Scholar, do the following:

 1. Search on Google Scholar for a paper of an author
 2. Create an Alert (for citations, new or similar publications)
 3. Create a Gmail filter, moving all those emails under a dedicated Label
 4. Run this tool to get an aggregated report (in Markdown or HTML) of all the papers from the unread emails

For more details, please refer to the [documentation](/docs).


# Install

Using a recent version of [`git`](https://git-scm.com) and [`go`](https://golang.org)
either build a `scholar-alert-digest` binary and put it under `$GOPATH/bin` with:

```
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && go mod init scholar-alert-digest  && go get github.com/bzz/scholar-alert-digest
```

or run it directly from the clone of the sources using `go` command, as described below.

# CLI

CLI tool for Markdown/HTML report generation.

## Test
It is possible to test it locally, without Gmail app configuration from below, by using emails from `./fixtures` by running:

```
go run main.go -test
```

## Configure

Enable "Gmail API" Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project & download `credentials.json` following [these steps](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/go#prerequisites).</br>
_That will guide you through creation of a new GCP project, enabling the Gmail API and geting "OAuth client ID" - [authorization credentials for a desktop application](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#oauth-client-id) that are needed in order to get access to your email messages at Gmail_


To find your specific label name:

`go run main.go -labels`

To generate the report, either pass the label name though CLI:

`go run main.go -l '<your-label-name>'`

Or export it as an env var:

```shell
export SAD_LABEL='<your-label-name>'
go run main.go
```

## Run
To output rendered HTML or JSON instead of the default Markdown, use
```
go run main.go -html
go run main.go -json
```

To mark all emails that were aggregated in the current report as read, use
```
go run main.go -mark
```

To include read emails in the separate section of the report, do
```
go run main.go -read
```

To only aggregate the email subjects do
```
go run main.go -subj | uniq -c | sort -dr
```

There is an optional more compact report template that may be useful for a large number of papers:
```
go run main.go -compact
```

To include authors in the paper details snippet, use
```
go run main.go -authors
```

To include references to original email into the report, do:
```
go run main.go -refs
```

# Webserver
The Web UI exposes HTML report generation to multiple concurrent users.

## Test
It is possible to test it locally, without Gmail app configuration from below, by using emails from `./fixtures` by running:

```
go run ./cmd/server -test
```

## Configure
It does not support the same OAuth client credentials as CLI from `credentials.json`.

It requires:
 - To create a new credentials in your API project `https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=quickstart-<NNN>`
 - "Credentials" -> "Create credentials" -> "Web application" type
 - Add http://localhost/login/authorized value to `Authorized redirect URIs` field
 - Copy the `Client ID` and `Client secret`

Pass in the ID and the secret as env vars e.g by
```shell
export SAD_GOOGLE_ID='<client id>'
export SAD_GOOGLE_SECRET='<client secret>'
```

You do not need to pass the label name on the startup as it can be chosen at
runtime at [/labels](http://localhost:8080/labels).

## Run
The report generation is exposed through a web server that can be started with
```
go run ./cmd/server [-compact]
```

to spin up a server at http://localhost:8080

Start by visiting http://localhost:8080/login to get the user OAuth access token.
Visit http://localhost:8080/labels to chose your label name.

## Deploy
To deploy, you need to build a backend and the frontend first:
```sh
./build.sh
```

At the moment, `server` will serve static resources from the `./ frontend/dist` from `/static`.

Actual deployment \w k8s descriptor is TBD.
